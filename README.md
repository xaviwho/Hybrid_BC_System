# Hybrid Blockchain-based Incognito Data Sharing with Quantum Computing

A secure IoT data management system incorporating:
- ML-based data filtering and classification
- Hybrid blockchain architecture (private + public)
- Quantum-secured communication

## System Architecture

This system is designed to securely manage IoT data with a focus on privacy and controlled sharing:

1. **IoT Data Collection**: Collects data from various IoT devices
2. **ML Processing Layer**:
   - Acts as initial gateway (filters what data enters private blockchain)
   - Serves as privacy filter (determines what data can be shared when requested)
3. **Private Blockchain**: Stores mission-critical/sensitive data
4. **Public Blockchain**: Interface for requesting filtered data and storing non-critical information
5. **Quantum Security Layer**: Protects data communication channels using quantum cryptography

## Use Case Example

Medical IoT devices collect patient data. The ML layer filters and stores sensitive medical data in the private blockchain. When external entities request data through the public blockchain, the ML layer evaluates which data elements are shareable and provides only non-critical information.
